CloudArcade is both a step in the future and in the past in the gaming world.
CloudArcade aims to bring back the Retro 8-bit games to life by streaming the game online and scaling in and out the hosts as needed and required. 

CloudArcade uses a slightly modified version of https://github.com/lifning/python-retro which is a python API for libretro.
