# CloudArcade
As the next step in the gaming world is Cloud Gaming. 
CloudArcade is an effort in the same direction.
CloudArcade aims to bring back the Retro 8-bit games to life by live streaming the game online and scaling in and out the hosts as needed and required. 

CloudArcade uses a slightly modified version of https://github.com/lifning/python-retro which is a python API for libretro.
